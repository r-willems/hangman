Hangman game in C language

I created coded this game to test my knowledge of C language so far. It was a fun journey, though very time consuming, as this was my first
full programming project. I am aware that there is probabaly a lot that could be improved in terms of efficiency, however I am happy with the 
result I managed with my, currently, limited experience.
The list of words the program chooses from is assembled with the help of ChatGPT (hence the redundance of fruit-themed words).

To try it at your own machine, you would need a compiler for C and a directory containing both 'hangman.c' and 'words.txt'.
